# Leetime

A simple timer for leetcode to avoid spending too much time on one problem.
The existing ones didn't work or the ones that did didn't have the basic 
thing that I wanted. This ones lacks lots of things too but this is all I 
could build in 3hrs.

How to install?
- Clone the repo.
- Go to chrome://extensions and turn on developer mode.
- Click on "Load unpacked" and select the cloned directory.
- That's it!
